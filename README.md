# üöó Car Insurance Claim Prediction & Customer Behavior Analysis

This project aims to **predict whether a car insurance customer will file a claim** and to analyze patterns in customer behavior.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning modeling** to derive insights and predictive capabilities for better decision-making in the insurance industry.

The dataset contains customer demographic, financial, and behavioral information.  
Key columns include:
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Marital Status**

|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 0.85     | 0.82      | 0.78   | 0.80     |
| Random Forest      | 0.88     | 0.85      | 0.82   | 0.83     |
| XGBoost            | **0.90** | **0.88**  | **0.86** | **0.87** |

**Best Model:** XGBoost
